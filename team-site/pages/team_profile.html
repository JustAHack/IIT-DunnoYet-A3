    <h2>Roles</h2>

    <article class="card">
    
      <h3>Have you defined any specific roles for your project?</h3>
      <p>
        With only 2 members of the team, roles were decided unanimously in relation to the capabilities of the members. Following will describe the role of each member and justify the role to that member.
      <br><br>
        <b>Jo: - Project Leader</b>
        Given the idea was Jo’s from the beginning, the role of Project Leader was initially unanimous in agreement. Further, outside of RMIT, Jo is also currently studying Introduction to DevOps with IBM. The knowledge Jo has brought over from learning DevOps methods has allowed the team to grasp a firm idea of how our project should come together. Jo has also shown ability at fantastic leadership in previous group work efforts.
      <br><br>
        <b>Thomas: - Project Developer</b>
        Thomas, having previous experience and knowledge of programming and project development again sought a unanimous decision that Thomas would be the Project Developer. Given that Thomas has skills in languages, tools and processes required to develop our project from start to finish. Further, Thomas has desire to develop web-based software which gave the project its initial direction, allowing design progression as well as a development plan.

      <h2>Group Processes</h2>

    <article class="card">
      
      <h3>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, our team had a couple of major hiccups, but with a lot of effort 2-3 of us pulled it off in time. While we thought our group was getting along well, abruptly our team leader left the group without notifying anyone within the team. This caused chaos in the last week of the assignment, while some were reluctant to pick up extra work, one in the final days did put in extra effort, unfortunately another that had accepted a bigger than original workload, in final 2 days was uncontactable and a large portion of content was not uploaded therefore inaccessible to the team. between an effort of 3 we got the missing work completed. The last 2-3 days was hectic for 2 members with the help of a 3rd in remaining hours. Overall, what looked to be a group working well collapsed in remaining week and half the team picking up for the other half.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes in process for Assignment 3?</h3>
      <p>
        Moving on for Assignment 3 there are big changes. Following our experience, Jo contacted Anthony requesting for herself and Thomas to continue the remainder of the course as a pair. This request was granted; therefore, this assignment will be completed by Thomas and Jo together, with a new Project Idea moving forward. We will be utilizing teams appropriately, using GitHub appropriately between us, Jo will learn new tools to assist in accomplishing requirements and we will utilize organizational tools.

      <h2>Team Processes and Communication</h2>
    <article class="card">

      <h4>How will your group communicate</h4>
      <p>
        Being a team of 2 allows communications to be simpler. Using MS Teams to collaborate our work and posting updates. Further the use of Trello to keep updated on progress. We also use Discord for instant messaging.
      </p>
      <h4>Meetings</h4>
      <p>
        Meetings to take place twice a week via MS Teams, recorded with video. Planned meetings every Tuesday and Friday at 10pm, with unwritten agreement if either member is unavailable, meeting to be held at earliest convenience.
      </p>
      <h4>Communication Expectation</h4>
      <p>
        Regular interactions, generally daily, regarding what we have achieved and any questions or confirmations, usually in Discord. Major announcements in Teams.
      </p>
      <h4>Team Processess</h4>
      <p>
        If a member is unable to complete a task, do any work etc due to being unwell or unavailable they must communicate this to the team with a post on MS Teams or Discord assuring that at least one team member receives the notification and responds.
        <br><br>
        If a member has issues with another member they must solve the issue as soon as possible within a professional manner, preferably personally and not in the open in front of other team members. If a resolution cannot be reached, they should reach out to the lecturing staff to try and reach a solution with their assistance.
      </p>

      <h2>Group reflection</h2>

    <article class="card">

        <h3>Group:</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>
          The creation of our prototype, we had originally believed we would have to create a prototype in Figma of what the user interface might be, however we released we had enough time to build a prototype in code that would run on a web server and provide the functionality of calculating wages from a form that recorded shift data. Soon realising this was far too simple still, and that there were still a few weeks left we were able to produce a fully functioning prototype that provided authentication, authorization, user registration and the viewing, creating, updating and deletion of shifts was the highlight of this project.
        </p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>
          Our time management, unfortunately as a team we often put our arranged meeting times aside to have our meeting at a time that felt more comfortable to how we felt at the time, usually due to the fact we often had headaches, felt sick etc. In the future it would be better to stick to our arrangements rather than put them off for convenience.
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
        <p>
          The amount of research and work involved in putting together a project of this size with just two people is rather significant and was a greater challenge than expected. As a team we had to research topics we were both familiar and unfamiliar with, Jo spent time researching DevOps, HTML, CSS and other numerous tools and technologies while Thomas spent time researching C# Razor Pages, Entity framework core and software architecture. This has provided us with newfound knowledge and reinforced knowledge of existing topics. 
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>
          Regardless of the size of your group, you can achieve great things when you work together with others. If team members are willing to work together, understand the strengths and weaknesses of each other than you can achieve great things. As a group we have learned many things, built a functioning prototype, developed a team website and written a lengthy and detailed report. This has brought us closer to our personal goals and helped develop team building skills for our future
        </p>

        <h3>Thomas:</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>
          Jo and I got along very well during assignment two and can understand one another quite well, so thinking up a new project idea was simple and easy for us that would allow our skills to shine through. Thankfully due to this, I have been able to apply my knowledge of software development and programming to the test to create a prototype that I feel is worthy of the time made available to us and with just a team of two individuals, with one who is new to I.T. Jo has been instrumental in helping me with tasks that I otherwise struggle with. This has ultimately led to us creating what I believe to be a fantastic project that I hope meets and goes beyond your expectations considering it is the product of just two individuals.
        </p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>
          I struggle to find many things to improve considering the teamwork of Jo and I. However, I suppose we could have done more stick to a better structure for our team meetings, we often put them off by a day or two most weeks because we were struggling with many real-life issues most weeks, myself because I am a carer for two people at home.
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
        <p>
          How much I have learned from being able to spend some of my spare time during this subject learning useful paradigms and techniques in software development. I’ve been able to obtain a decent understanding of domain-driven development, the CQRS pattern and a better general understanding of C# and its latest long-term release.
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>
          Trust, being able to trust in team members is paramount to success in group work. Working with Jo has allowed me to be more trusting in others to get work done if you spend time to know them and understand how they complete their work. Assignment two gave me trust issues with team members, however in this assignment, Jo has helped me see that not everyone is lazy and untrustworthy.
        </p>

        <h3>Jo:</h3>
        <h4>What went well</h4>
        <p>
          During A2 we learnt that the two of us worked well, I find with my skills in academic writing coupled with Thomas’ knowledge from study and previous experience has been a successful match. We have successfully completed a task set for 4-6 people as a team of 2 with only 2 smaller sections removed as per ELS plan. We were able to get further than initially planned with production of the project. I felt my learning of DevOps helped greatly on the development process. Our interpersonal skills are similar, which enabled us to communicate and work together well.
        </p>
        <h4>What could be improved</h4>
        <p>
          I believe the assignment document could be delivered with clearer direction on what is required. Some parts are difficult to determine what is being asked. In relation to working as a team, I believe there is not a lot more could have been done to improve.
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that was surprising</h4>
        <p>
          The progress we ended up making toward the project was a pleasant surprise. We initially hoped we would have time to deliver a working code prototype of the main feature, however, with Thomas’ abilities we ended up being able to provide a prototype of all main features.
        </p>
        <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
        <p>
          Regular communication was key to the success we had working together. The lack of communication from most members in the group for A2 was seen in the results of the work. It is more work per person, although working in a smaller team can prove to be as equally functional in minimal timeframe when proper processes and communication are in place and followed.
