      <h2>Project TiMe</h2>
          
      <h3>Topic</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Purpose Proposal:</strong> Develop a Project Management and  Shift Schedule with pay calculator application targeted at freelance workers and individual employees. The name of our Project is TiMe, which extends to Time Me. TiMe will be hosted on a cloud server, allowing easy, real-time access to all data saved to your account, from any device. TiMe will be accessible through web browsers, desktop app and on all mobile devices. For freelancers, they will be able to integrate with project management services such as Trello and GitHub; Additionally, all users will be able to integrate with major calendar service providers, such as Google, Outlook, Apple Calendars, and others. TiMe will calculate either shift log in hours by payment rate for individual employees; or by project agreement where timed or flat rate can be entered and calculated for freelance workers.
        </p> 
        <p>
          <strong>Development Proposal:</strong> Develop a web-based application where users can create an account and start logging their work shifts within a minute. To build this system we will need to build up a user account system, timesheet management system, and these two systems will be accessible through an API to separate the concerns of our business model and user interface (UI). The application will also have a persistence layer that is separate from the business layer and UI layer. Looking to the future we plan to integrate already in use cloud calendar systems so that shift reminders can be set across multiple mail and/or calendar services and accessible on any device. <em>(See Diagram below for system setup.)</em>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          TiMe is a cloud-based Project Manager and Shift tracker with payment calculator. TiMe is designed for use by freelance workers and employees. The payment calculator syncs to your project or your shift tracker and calculates at an hourly rate or by specified project agreement, such as per unit of work completed. Further it is intended that TiMe will integrate with multiple major calendar services such as Google, Outlook, Apple, and Samsung Calendars, while also integrating with project management services such as GitHub, Trello, web browsers, including intended browser extension. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          With working remote or from home becoming a more permanent trend, online shift scheduling and automatic pay rate calculators are becoming essential. For employees, depending on the service of choice of the employer, often employees are unable to see their actual logged hours or automatic pay calculation. Freelance work is in abundance in IT industry and having a cloud base application that helps track not only progression of projects but calculates by hour or by project agreement the amount you have earnt, is a tool that will become more essential during a time that is seeing businesses merging to cloud computing. Although TiMe is not designed for use by businesses, Freelance workers’ clients will usually be business likely in progress of merging or already using cloud computing services.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <em>What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project?</em><br>
          Potential Employers would observe knowledge of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) which include the following: Planning and Analysis, Design and Creativity, Development, and testing. We do not include the Maintenance part of the SDLC as the product would not likely be deployed within the 15 weeks provided. Employers would also be shown our problem-solving skills such as ability to analyse a problem, break down the problem into smaller individual challenges and solve those small challenges to create an outcome for the overall problem. Further, employers would be shown that as a team we are capable of learning multiple programming languages and are able to mix and match these languages and technologies to create a product, which is Software as a Service (SaaS). Employers would see work using methods of DevOps; Full Stack Development; and use of Cloud-based computing service for application deployment.

      <h3>Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          Currently there are countless numbers of employee shift trackers for businesses, shift tracker mobile apps, or online hour to pay calculators. Further, there are time and project management services available for freelancers, however in much smaller numbers. The Australian Government’s Fair Work Ombudsman website has an app available on android devices called ‘Record my hours’ app which you can set roster to calendar; notifications of shifts; back-up to iCloud or Dropbox (Fair Work Ombudsman, 2022). Another application quite like TiMe  is Harvest Intuitive Timesheet app, similar to TiMe, has web and mobile app access; similar features to our project are start/stop timers, Invoicing, Team Management & payment for freelancers; Integrates with GitHub, Trello, Xero, multiple browsers, Google Calendar, and Workspace (Getharvest, 2022). Another application with features like TiMe is Clockify, the most popular of apps I found, similarly is available to freelancers and use by employees. Clockify features a one-click timer to track work time; missing time can be added manually; Automatic calculation by billable rate; Integrates also with Trello and GitHub, Gitlab, Azure DevOps, Monday, JIRA and more. Features specific to freelancers include Share summary and weekly report, organize projects, and assign rate by project. Clockify can be accessed by web browser or browser extension, desktop, and mobile app (Clockify, 2022). Multiple sources suggested the best apps are Clickup; Buddy Punch; Toggl; Harvest; ATracker; Time Doctor; Rescue Time; and Time Camp. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Fair Work Ombudsman’s app is only available on Android devices and does not allow for freelancers’ project management. Harvest’s timesheet app has component features particularly for businesses that will not be integrated into our project, such as Reports and Analysis, Track time from devices and build and integrate own API (Application Programming Interface). Clockify is certainly the most similar to ours, however, offers a few features not intended to be in our project. It was observed that much of what is available most like TiMe were mobile only applications, most available apps that had web browser and mobile application access were intended for business to manage employees shifts and pay. In addition, what is available for Freelance workers is a much smaller portion of available applications and most built for particular types of freelance work. TiMe is accessible to any type of freelance worker or person who needs to track their work or project schedule and hours worked; as well as pay a calculator.
