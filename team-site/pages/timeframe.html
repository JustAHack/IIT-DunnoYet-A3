        <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
        <p>
          Designing and building a project of any size with a team of two is a limitation on its own. Going into this assessment task with team changes and choosing to begin a totally new project idea further limited the time available for planning and preparation. The first 3 weeks to be spent deciding the features and the production process, which would have been done in the time of A2 originally. Further, the knowledge and experience of team members provides another limitation, each feature needs to be built in a particular way and needs certain processes to perform its function, and although there is some level of knowledge and skill in both members, with lack of time and experience some features would take longer, due to requiring the learning of that code or process. 
        <br><br>
          Making TiMe Unique while keeping within appropriate limits and being aware of scope creep was always taken into account while planning, this reduced the number of features we would need to drop or delay within the project plan. One feature that is not intended to be implemented until application is finished and likely deployed through a cloud service provider is the calendar integration with pre-existing calendars, we would need to research how this is implemented into our code. 
        <br><br>
          Further, a cloud service provider would not be chosen until after project is near completion. We would need solid progress with code to and able to get quotes from individual providers for price for service package. We would be seeking the most suited package to host our application along with the most cost effective. This process also likely to extend time to deployment.
        <br><br>
          It is intended we will have, at minimum, a working, coded prototype of the main feature of the application by week 5, the completion of A3. However, effort will be made to have more than the minimum.

              Jo: Week 1 was spent re-evaluating moving into A3 as a team of 2. A decision was made we would start a new project, and we decided on the idea of expanding the shift tracker. We had a discussion around deliverables of the project. Added tasks to Trello. Created team name (DunnoYet) and Project application name (TiMe) unanimous agreement to host on cloud as SaaS. Developed verbal plan for research. Discussed GitHub repo configuration.

              Discussed who is responsible for which part of website code. Research deeper into Testing. Suggested offering main feature to use without having to create account.
