          Hi I'm Jo,
          Born in Victoria, I grew up in a small town marked 'the centre of Victoria'. I'm 36 years old; I have two children, a 14yo son and a 10yo daughter. I wanted to be a paramedic and was very passionate about it. I spent six years as a volunteer First Responder (Advanced First Aid) with St John Ambulance Victoria, including 18 months as a grade IIII operations officer. As a result of my medical diagnosis, I could not continue in the medical field. Therefore, I re-evaluated what I could do, and the outcome happened to be Information Technology (IT). My decision to choose to study IT was very influential. Through conversation with a programmer friend, I began to realise I have a deep underlying interest in the future of technology and how it can help for good.

    <h2>Group Processes</h2>

    <article>
      
      <h3>How well did your group work together in Assignment 2?</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, our team had a couple of major hiccups, but with a lot of effort 2-3 of us pulled it off in time. While we thought our group was getting along well, abruptly our team leader left the group without notifying anyone within the team. This caused chaos in the last week of the assignment, while some were reluctant to pick up extra work, one in the final days did put in extra effort, unfortunately another that had accepted a bigger than original workload, in final 2 days was uncontactable and a large portion of content was not uploaded therefore inaccessible to the team. between an effort of 3 we got the missing work completed. The last 2-3 days was hectic for 2 members with the help of a 3rd in remaining hours. Overall, what looked to be a group working well collapsed in remaining week and half the team picking up for the other half.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes in process for Assignment 3?</h3>
      <p>
        Moving on for Assignment 3 there are big changes. Following our experience, Jo contacted Anthony requesting for herself and Thomas to continue the remainder of the course as a pair. This request was granted; therefore, this assignment will be completed by Thomas and Jo together, with a new Project Idea moving forward. We will be utilizing teams appropriately, using GitHub appropriately between us, Jo will learn new tools to assist in accomplishing requirements and we will utilize organizational tools.
