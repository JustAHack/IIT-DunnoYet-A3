        <h2>Scope and Limits & Timeframe</h2>
        
      </article>

      <article class="card">
        <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
        <p>
          At this point will describe the scope of our project and the limitations within the team and the project. The first and biggest limitation the team has is doing the required tasks with only 2 people while made suitable for 4-6 people. Time limitation was another limitation for the team, given an entire new project was commenced for A3, the time used for planning during A2 was lost. Knowledge and experience of the members of the team is another factor to be considered. Further, a project of this calibre needs to be unique while being mindful of the scope and timeframe. The project would be delivered using a SaaS service through a cloud service provider, requiring choice of suitable service provider.
        </p> 
        <p>
          Designing and building a project of any size with a team of two is a limitation on its own. Given the complexity of requirements and the time required to write up documentation and put into a website, this heavily restricted the time the team have available to spend learning new aspects helpful to implement into the production of the project. Further, time spent on each section is restricted by needing to have both members working on report, and website and working towards a prototype, while also allowing time for A5 presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going into this assessment task with team changes and choosing to begin a totally new project idea further limited the time available for planning and preparation. The first 3 weeks to be spent deciding the features and the production process, which would have been done in the time of A2 originally. Resulting in some early decisions rushed, and development processes mixed due to lack of time to concentrate on process design
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the knowledge and experience of team members provides another limitation, each feature needs to be built in a particular way and needs certain processes to perform its function. Although there is some level of knowledge and skill in both members, with lack of time and experience some features would take longer, due to requiring the learning of that code or process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making TiMe Unique while keeping within appropriate limits and being aware of scope creep was always taken into account while planning, this reduced the number of features we would need to drop or delay within the project plan. One feature that is not intended to be implemented until application is finished and likely deployed through a cloud service provider, and available on all platforms, is the calendar integration with pre-existing calendars, we would need to research how this is implemented into our code. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, a cloud service provider would not be chosen until after    project is near completion. We would need solid progress with code to be able to get quotes from individual providers for price for service package. We would be seeking the most suited package to host our application along with the most cost effective. This process also likely to extend time to deployment. The cost of using SaaS through a cloud service provider is likely another limitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given all the above limitations of few members, restricted time with particular requirements, low-mid level knowledge and experience, and strict timeframe, is it unlikely the project will be deployable ready. However, it is intended we will have, at minimum, a working, coded prototype of the main feature of the application by week 5, the completion of A3. However, effort will be made to have more than the minimum. While a minimum product will be readily deployable, it will not be actively deployed for use.

              Jo: Week 1 was spent re-evaluating moving into A3 as a team of 2. A decision was made we would start a new project, and we decided on the idea of expanding the shift tracker. We had a discussion around deliverables of the project. Added tasks to Trello. Created team name (DunnoYet) and Project application name (TiMe) unanimous agreement to host on cloud as SaaS. Developed verbal plan for research. Discussed GitHub repo configuration.
